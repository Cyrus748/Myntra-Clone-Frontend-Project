## Project Overview
This project is a frontend clone of the popular e-commerce platform [Myntra](https://www.myntra.com/). The goal is to replicate the look and feel of the Myntra website's homepage using HTML and CSS. This project focuses on the static layout and responsiveness of the homepage, including the header, navigation, search bar, banner, category sections, and footer.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes to ensure an optimal viewing experience across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Header**: Includes navigation links, a search bar, and action icons (Profile, Wishlist, Bag).
- **Promotional Banners**: Displayed at the top to highlight offers and categories.
- **Category Sections**: Showcases different categories and promotional images to simulate an e-commerce catalog layout.
- **Footer**: Contains structured links to different sections like "Online Shopping," "Customer Service," and "About Myntra."

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive design.
- **Google Material Icons**: For icons used in the action bar (Profile, Wishlist, Bag).
- **Google Fonts**: For custom fonts to match Myntra's styling.
